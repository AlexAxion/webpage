        	Hello, My name is Xavier Alexander Romero but most refer to me as Alex. I'm 21 years old and as of 2023 I’m a student at MJC currently working towards a computer science major. Reasoning for my major is as simple as it gets, I love coding. There’s something so satisfying about solving an issue with your code when your previous iterations made you want to pull your hair out. I’ve had this satisfaction using C, C++, Assembly, Java, and Rust. My last language Rust has been a blast and a great substitute for C++. Some very recent languages I've been learning include CSS, HTML, and javascript in the form of react. Ever since I joined Community ali my motivation to code has skyrocketed since it’s really challenged me. Javascript is hell to learn but it’s still a lot of fun watching everything work in harmony with react. If you’d like to learn more about Community ali and how it's affected me click the button below called Community ali. The other button leads to my Calculator app I coded in react and it's something I’m really proud of.

        	As you’ve read one of my hobbies include coding but additionally I'm very much a fan of PC gaming. I love playing cod zombies, Overwatch, left for dead 2, and Starcraft. Gaming has been one of my passions since I was 7 years old and I don't regret it once.
