     Hello, My name is Xavier Alexander Romero but most refer to me as Alex. 
     I'm 21 years old and as of 2023 I’m a student at MJC currently working 
     towards a computer science major. Reasoning for my major is as simple 
     as it gets, I love coding. There’s something so satisfying about solving 
     an issue with your code when your previous iterations made you want to 
     pull your hair out. I’ve had this satisfaction using C, C++, Assembly, 
     Java, and Rust. My last language Rust has been a blast and a great 
     substitute for C++. Some very recent languages I've been learning include 
     CSS, HTML, and javascript in the form of react. Ever since I joined 
     Community ali my motivation to code has skyrocketed since it’s really 
     challenged me. Javascript is hell to learn but it’s still a lot of fun 
     watching everything work in harmony with react. A great example is low 
     and behold this website. When I started, the website would constantly 
     crash and buttons to the other pages did nothing when you clicked them. 
     It’s come a long way and I'm proud of what it's become. If you’d like to 
     learn more about Community ali and how it's affected me, scroll to the 
     bottom, then click the button below called Community ali. The other buttons 
     lead to my Calculator app I coded in React and it's something I’m really 
     proud of.

        	As you’ve read one of my hobbies include coding but additionally 
          I'm very much a fan of PC gaming. I love playing cod zombies, 
          Overwatch, left for dead 2, and Starcraft. Gaming has been one of 
          my passions since I was 7 years old and I don't regret it once.
