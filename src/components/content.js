        	Hello, my name is Xavier Alexander Romero and coding experiences are 
          as follows, Rust, C++, Assembly, and React. My interest in coding stems 
          from my desire to create in which coding is my medium. The very site 
          you’re interacting with is written in react and I'm very proud of it. 
          If you would like to see the src code click the button below near contacts called 
          github. I love sitting down any part of the day just to code as I love 
          discovering what could be created. Out of all the languages I’ve described 
          I would have to say Rust is my favorite as you can code at a very low or high 
          level as you’d like. If you’d like to see other React projects click the button 
          labeled calculator or if you’d like to see experiences I’ve had with groups click 
          Community Ali.
