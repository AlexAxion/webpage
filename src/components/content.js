        	Hello, My name is Xavier Alexander Romero but most refer to me as Alex. I'm 21 years old and as of 2023 I’m a student at MJC currently working towards a computer science major. Reasoning for my major is as simple as it gets, I love coding. There’s something so satisfying about solving an issue with your code when your previous iterations made you want to pull your hair out.

        	The game I tested was The Butterfly, The BFG, and Bendore created by Jeremy Stephens. When I played the game it was with 2 others as it is a 3 player game. I greatly enjoyed the game as it had elements that kept me engaged. For example, Bendore and the Butterfly are forced to move in opposite directions while the BFG can move whichever he pleases. I also like the average time a game lasts which is perfect. 15 minutes is just enough for myself to get invested while not too long where I become bored.
	The only aspect I would say I disliked was how overpowered the BFG was. His ability to move in any direction makes him able to reach anyone with ease. It also makes it impossible for anyone to catch him as he could run away in the opposite direction where no one could get to him. It didn't happen often but playing as the BFG encourages you to rush someone right off the bat as if they won the dice roll you could then run in the opposite direction. I also found the butterfly underpowered as he could only defend. There are no ways to initiate combat leaving you playing on the defense.
	What I would change about the game starting with the BFG, he should have to roll an odd or even to change directions making him think more before using a turn to attempt changing directions. I would also make the butterfly able to attack instead of being only able to defend. Overall I think Jeremy did a fantastic job on the game and I loved the experience I had playing with other players. It's crystal clear he put his heart and soul into it and I can appreciate that.
